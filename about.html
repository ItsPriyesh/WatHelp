WatHelp was created to help students connect with tutors and be able to learn the material they are taught. The overall goal of this web application is to create an easy way to find help anytime it is required. Instead of going onto Kijiji or another marketplace for tutoring services and scavenge through tons of posts to find someone who might be useful in the relevant course; one can easily search who specializes in the course they need help with, and get help from that tutor. 
<br>WatHelp was created during the University of Waterloo EngHack 2014. Consisting of first year engineering students: Colin Kilner, Priyesh Patel, Sahibjot Saggu and Umesh Kumar Khanna. Having a passion for web development and Android development, we decided to create an application to easily get help for any course rather than having to waste time avoiding studying the course.
